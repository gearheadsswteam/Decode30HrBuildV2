/**
 * Test flywheel with RPM controller, tuned live via FTCDashboard
 *
 * üõ† Step 1 ‚Äì Safety & Setup
 *
 * Make sure your robot is stable on the field tile (wheels won‚Äôt slip).
 *
 * Place a target goal or taped mark at the distance you want to shoot.
 *
 * Fully charge your battery ‚Äî low voltage will skew results.
 *
 * Use FTCDashboard telemetry to monitor target RPM and actual RPM.
 *
 * üéØ Step 2 ‚Äì RPM Validation (No Balls Yet)
 *
 * Run your flywheel at a chosen targetRPM (say 3000 RPM).
 *
 * Watch Dashboard telemetry for actual RPM.
 *
 * It should settle close to target (¬±100 RPM is usually OK).
 *
 * If it oscillates: lower kP.
 *
 * If it lags or never reaches target: raise kP.
 *
 * Test multiple setpoints (2000, 2500, 3000, 3500 RPM) to make sure control loop behaves smoothly.
 *
 * üèê Step 3 ‚Äì Single Ball Testing
 *
 * Load one ball at a time into the flywheel.
 *
 * Fire at your target while logging actual RPM.
 *
 * Watch for:
 *
 * Distance: does it land short/long?
 *
 * Consistency: do multiple shots land in the same area?
 *
 * Recovery: after a shot, does the RPM dip and then recover fast (<0.5s)?
 *
 * üëâ If shots are short ‚Üí increase targetRPM.
 * üëâ If shots are overshooting ‚Üí decrease targetRPM.
 * üëâ If recovery is slow ‚Üí increase kP slightly, or check if your flywheel has enough inertia.
 *
 * üìä Step 4 ‚Äì Systematic Distance Calibration
 *
 * Place markers at 1 ft intervals on the field (e.g., 6 ft, 8 ft, 10 ft).
 *
 * Shoot 3‚Äì5 balls at each distance with a fixed RPM.
 *
 * Record the average landing point.
 *
 * Build a table like:
 *
 * Target Distance (ft)	Best RPM
 * 6 ft	2400 RPM
 * 8 ft	2800 RPM
 * 10 ft	3200 RPM
 * üîß Step 5 ‚Äì Accuracy Tuning
 *
 * Adjust RPM in small steps (¬±50‚Äì100 RPM) and retest.
 *
 * Try different ball types/conditions (new, worn, squishy) to see variation.
 *
 * If variation is large, you may need:
 *
 * More flywheel inertia (heavier wheel).
 *
 * Double flywheel design (top + bottom).
 *
 * Better feeder consistency.
 *
 * üß™ Step 6 ‚Äì Stress Test
 *
 * Fire a full magazine (5‚Äì10 balls) as fast as your intake feeds.
 *
 * Monitor if RPM holds close to target between shots.
 *
 * If it dips too much, you may need higher kP or even a feed delay so flywheel recovers before next shot.
 *
 * üèÜ Step 7 ‚Äì Finalize
 *
 * Pick 1‚Äì2 standard RPMs (e.g., ‚Äúshort shot‚Äù and ‚Äúlong shot‚Äù).
 *
 * Hard-code those in your TeleOp with gamepad buttons.
 *
 * Keep tuning table in your engineering notebook for Worlds-style scouting.
